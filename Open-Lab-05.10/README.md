(25 XP) Reverse coding challenge.

Welcome to the reverse coding challenge! Normally you would have instructions on how to create a function. This time you'll need to create one that will satisfy the relation between the input and the output (check the examples section).

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Open solution file in Visual Studio.
3. Open file `Challenge.cs`.
4. Implement the method `MysteryFunc(int num)` that will satisfy the relation between the input and the output.
5. Run with `CTRL+F5` to test it.
6. If all tests are passed, commit & sync your repository.
7. Send a link to your repository for Lab Master (in #slack) to check it.

## Examples: 
```C#
MysteryFunc(152) ➞ 10
MysteryFunc(832) ➞ 48
MysteryFunc(19) ➞ 9
MysteryFunc(133) ➞ 9
```
